# Support

## Do the Five

The biggest support everyone could do is to stay safe and do our part to make it through this.

Help stop coronavirus

 - 1 HANDS Wash them often
 - 2 ELBOW Cough into it
 - 3 FACE Don't touch it
 - 4 SPACE Keep safe distance
 - 5 HOME Stay if you can

## Support Restuarants

Many Restaurants are still open for business - take advantage of their takeout programs. Like Orlando's To-go Site https://www.visitorlando.com/en/things-to-do/restaurants/orlando-togo
